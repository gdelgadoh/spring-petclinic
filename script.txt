•	Emphasize that the focus will be on live demonstrations to showcase the tools in action.

Why VS Code:
•	Explain the advantages of using Visual Studio Code as an editor-centric environment that enhances code creation experience.
•	Mention its lightweight nature, quick start-up times, and responsiveness, making it user-friendly.
•	Note its evolution from a web development tool to support various languages through extensions.

Spring Tooling Extension Pack:
•	Introduce the Visual Studio Code extension pack specifically tailored for Spring Boot development.
•	Highlight the extensions included, such as Spring Initializer, Spring Tools, and Spring Boot Dashboard.

Demo Plan Overview:
•	Outline the structure of the demo, focusing on the inner loop scenario.
•	Mention that the goal is to showcase the power of tooling to develop, debug, and test applications.

Live Coding and Debugging:
•	Walk the audience through the process of creating a Spring Boot project using Spring Initializer.
•	Showcase how to start the application in debug mode within VS Code.
•	Demonstrate the convenience of hot code replacement, which allows for seamless debugging without application restarts.
•	Showcase the Spring Boot Dashboard's visualization of live information from the application.

Interaction with Rory:
•	Ask Rory to share his experience with creating spring boot projects
•	Engage Rory while showing the live metrics for APIs, memory view

JUnit Testing and Code Analysis:
•	Explain how VS Code supports running JUnit test cases.

Code Analysis and Validation:
•	Discuss code analysis and validation features that help ensure code quality and adherence to Spring coding standards.
•	Summarize the inner-loop journey: streamlined project generation, efficient development, debugging, testing, and validations.

Transition to Rory:
•	Transition to the next part of the presentation, where Rory will take over to discuss outer-loop scenarios.

Wrap-up:
•	Thank the audience for their time and attention.
•	Encourage attendees to check out the provided links for more information and resources.
•	Mention about “Meet the Experts” session
